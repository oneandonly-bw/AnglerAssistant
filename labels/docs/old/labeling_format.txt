✅ Rules embedded in this snippet:

surface = exact text from sentence
canonical = required CANONICAL dictionary entry
variant = optional, only for MOSTLY_USED/VARIANT -> dictionary entries marked as VARIANT or MOSTLY_USED are treated as VARIANT
start / end = offsets of surface in sentence (end exclusive)

forumUrl = forum identifier
topicUrl = topic identifier
lang = language code (ru/en/he)
